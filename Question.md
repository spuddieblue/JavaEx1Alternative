# Java Programming Task: Times Table with Even/Odd Identification

## **Question:**
Write a Java program that generates and displays the times table for a number entered by the user, while also identifying whether each result is an even or odd number.

---

## **Requirements**

### **Objective:**
- The program should prompt the user to enter a number.
- It should then generate the times table for that number, from 1 to 10.
- For each entry in the times table, the program should determine if the result is even or odd and display this information alongside the calculation.

---

### **Inputs:**
- The user will enter a single integer when prompted by the program. This number will be used to calculate the times table.

---

### **Processing:**
1. Use a loop (e.g., a `for` loop) to calculate the product of the user's input number with integers from 1 to 10.
2. After calculating each product, determine if the result is even or odd using the modulus operator (`%`).

---

### **Outputs:**
- For each iteration of the loop, the program should print a line displaying:
  - The multiplication operation (e.g., `4 x 2 = 8`).
  - Whether the result is even or odd (e.g., `Even!` or `Odd!`).
- The output format should look like this:
